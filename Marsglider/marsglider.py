#This is the function you will have to write for part A. 
#-The argument 'height' is a floating point number representing 
# the number of meters your glider is above the average surface based upon 
# atmospheric pressure. (You can think of this as height above 'sea level'
# except that Mars does not have seas.) Note that this sensor may be
# slightly noisy.
# This number will go down over time as your glider slowly descends.
#
#-The argument 'radar' is a floating point number representing the
# number of meters your glider is above the specific point directly below
# your glider based off of a downward facing radar distance sensor. Note that
# this sensor has random Gaussian noise which is different for each read.

#-The argument 'mapFunc' is a function that takes two parameters (x,y)
# and returns the elevation above "sea level" for that location on the map
# of the area your glider is flying above.  Note that although this function
# accepts floating point numbers, the resolution of your map is 1 meter, so
# that passing in integer locations is reasonable.
#
#
#-The argument OTHER is initially None, but if you return an OTHER from
# this function call, it will be passed back to you the next time it is
# called, so that you can use it to keep track of important information
# over time.
